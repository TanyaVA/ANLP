				<h1>Our Pastor</h1>

				<img class="textColumnContentContainer" src="Images/2018Images/Pastor/2ndsun2018.jpg" alt="alternate text" align="left" />
				<p>Keith D. Brooks has been serving as Senior Pastor of All Nations
          Life and Praise (formerly All Nations Church of God) since 2001,
          where he has been a member all of his life. Under his leadership,
          All Nations has experienced tremendous spiritual and physical growth.
          <br><br />Pastor Brooks was licensed and ordained under the headship of
          the late Bishop George Hoke, whom he succeeded as Pastor after his
          death in 2000. Having tall shoes to fill, Pastor Brooks has very
          capably carried on the legacy and teachings that his congregation
          was accustom to. He preaches the Word with vigor, fire, and
          conviction. Bringing Change, Restoration & A Message of Hope to the
          World, Pastor Keith D. Brooks is known as the preacher with
          "much energy". He is also a gifted organizer and administrator,
          which has allowed him to be instrumental in taking All Nations to
          higher heights. <br><br />As a young man of God, he serves as a mentor to
          many young people. This was evident even before he became Pastor
          while serving as a Youth Minister for many years. He has led many
          young men and women to Christ just by the example of holiness that
          he exemplifies. <br><br />Pastor Brooks was educated in the Dekalb County
          School System, graduating from Southwest Dekalb High School. He also
          attended Dekalb Technical Institute. He is retired from the
          Department of Family and Children Services.<br><br />In 1990, Pastor
          Brooks and his brother, Kendrick, organized the gospel group, "Keith
          Brooks and New Creation". This music ministry encompassedÂ a group of
          gifted singers and musicians, who not only performed musically, but
          ministers to the hearts of many under the anointing of God. Under
          the vision of Pastor Brooks, these ministers traveled throughout
          the United States and around the world, proclaiming the good news of
          Jesus Christ. The ministrels were blessed with the recordings of two
          studio projects, "Everlasting Love" and "Perfect Peace". <br><br />
          The sole and priority purpose of Pastor Brooks and the All Nations
          Life & Praise Ministry is to transform and change lives through the
          power of the Holy Ghost where they are committed to developing and
          training men and women to fulfill their purpose and destiny in
          Christ Jesus.</p>
